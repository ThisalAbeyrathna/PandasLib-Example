# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset contains details of product sales, including date, product name, units sold, revenue, and category. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and revenue growth rate calculations.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset (`sales_data.csv`) contains the following columns:
- **Date**: Date of the sale (YYYY-MM-DD format).
- **Product**: Product name (e.g., "Laptop", "Mobile", "Headphones").
- **Units Sold**: The number of units sold.
- **Revenue**: The total revenue from the sale.
- **Category**: The category of the product (e.g., "Electronics", "Accessories").

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is cleaned and processed as follows:
- Loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately (dropped or filled).
- Ensured the `Date` column is in the correct datetime format.
- Removed rows where `Units Sold` or `Revenue` is negative.

## Data Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Calculating the total revenue for each product using `groupby`.
- Computing the average units sold per product.
- Identifying the product with the highest revenue and highest units sold.

## Data Visualization
Using Matplotlib, the following visualizations are generated:
- **Bar Chart**: Displays the total revenue by product.
- **Line Plot**: Shows the trend of revenue over time.
- **Pie Chart**: Illustrates the distribution of revenue across different product categories.

## Bonus Calculation
- Calculates the revenue growth rate for each product by comparing total revenue in the first and last month of data.
- Identifies the product(s) with the highest growth rate.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **CSV**: Data storage and handling.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install & Setup Python
- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Ensure `pip` is installed and updated.
